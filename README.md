##  My God Is Able

When the mountain won't move and the storm won't cease,
When the nights are long and peace feels out of reach—
I remember one truth that never fails:
My God is able.

Able to part seas when I feel surrounded.
Able to calm winds when my heart is pounding.
Able to heal, to restore, to renew—
There is nothing too hard for what He can do.

When I am weak, He is strong.
When I fall short, His grace goes long.
Doors man closes, He can open wide.
Battles I lose, He still turns the tide.

He shut the mouths of lions for Daniel.
He walked in fire with Shadrach and friends.
He fed the five thousand with loaves and fish—
He fulfills every promise, every wish.

So no matter the test or the waiting time,
No matter the mountain I have to climb—
I stand in faith, and I will proclaim:
My God is able, forever the same.


My God is not just willing—
He is able.

Able to do exceedingly, abundantly above all
That I could ask, think, or even imagine.
When the world says “impossible,”
My God says, “Watch Me work.”

When I am burdened by pain too deep for words,
When the tears fall at night and the silence is loud,
When fear grips my heart and the future looks dim—
My God is able.

He was able in the beginning—when there was nothing,
He spoke, and light came bursting through darkness.
He carved mountains with His fingers
And told oceans where to stop.
That same power still lives and moves today.

He was able when Sarah laughed in doubt—
Yet her barren womb bore a promised son.
He was able when Joseph was thrown into a pit—
But later ruled a kingdom to save many.
He was able when Moses stood before a sea—
And saw it part like curtains before his feet.

My God is able.

He is not limited by time,
Not bound by circumstance,
Not intimidated by statistics,
Not discouraged by delay.

When the enemy says, “It’s over,”
God says, “I’m just getting started.”
When man says, “You’re not enough,”
God says, “I am more than enough.”

He is able to deliver, like He did for Daniel in the lion’s den.
Able to rescue, like He did for the Hebrew boys in the fire.
Able to provide, like He did with manna in the wilderness.
Able to heal, like He did for the blind and the broken.

His ability isn’t past tense.
It’s not just in the pages of ancient stories.
It’s right here. Right now. For you.

When the bank account is empty,
When the diagnosis is grim,
When relationships fall apart,
When prayers seem unanswered…

Still, I declare:
My God is able.

Able to give peace in the storm,
Joy in sorrow,
Strength in weakness,
Purpose in pain.

And even when He doesn’t move the mountain—
He gives me the strength to climb.
Even when the fire doesn’t stop—
He walks with me through the flame.

Because sometimes,
His greatest miracle isn’t in changing the situation—
It’s in changing me.

So today, I walk in boldness.
I speak with faith.
I live with confidence.
Not because of who I am,
But because of who He is:

My God is able.
